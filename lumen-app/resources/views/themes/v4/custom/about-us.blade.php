						<p class="story" data-bottom-top="opacity:0;top:0px;transform:rotate(0deg);" data-bottom="opacity:1;top:20px;transform-origin:0 0;">As high school teammates, STACK’s founders, Nick Palazzo and Chad Zimmerman, were unable to get the information they needed to reach their performance goals. As college football players at Harvard and Carnegie Mellon, respectively, they discovered that their teammates were equally uninformed about how to improve their performance as athletes. That realization led to the concept for STACK—a company dedicated to empowering and inspiring athletes through sports performance information and services. After creating an award-winning business plan for STACK while still in college, Nick and Chad launched the company shortly after graduation, first publishing STACK Magazine. During the first two weeks of marketing the Magazine, more than 3,000 high school athletic directors requested to receive the publication for their student-athletes. The first issue featured LeBron James and his high school training plan. Circulation of 300,000 copies was acquired virtually overnight. Sports industry titan Nike got behind the Company, buying ads in each issue, and STACK was off and running, the first issue releasing in February 2005. Since then STACK Magazine has grown rapidly. It is now requested by athletic directors in over 13,500 high schools—75% of the nation’s high schools with athletic programs—circulation exceeds 850,000, and it enjoys the largest teen readership in print in the U.S.—5.3 million readers per issue.
						<br><br>
						Over the next nearly 10 years, STACK grew from its print roots to become the leading sports performance service company in the country—with more than 15 million monthly unique visitors at STACK.com, the industry’s deepest content and video library featuring superstar professional athletes, critically acclaimed digital applications, and a network of 40+ owned and operated athlete training centers.</p>
